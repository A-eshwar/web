    <div class="fish-info">
      <h2>Betta Fish</h2>
      <p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are popular for their vivid colors and long, flowing fins. They are hardy and thrive in 5-gallon or larger tanks with warm, filtered water. Males are territorial and should be housed alone, while females can sometimes be kept in groups (sororities) with care. Betta fish enjoy exploring plants and floating logs.</p>

    <div class="fish-info">
      <h2>Goldfish</h2>
      <p>Goldfish are hardy freshwater fish that require more care than most people assume. They need large, well-filtered tanks (at least 20 gallons for one) and produce a lot of waste. They come in many varieties like comet, fantail, and oranda, each with unique care needs. Goldfish can live 10–15 years or longer with proper care.</p>

    <div class="fish-info">
      <h2>Guppy</h2>
      <p>Guppies are small, colorful livebearers that reproduce easily and thrive in community tanks. They are peaceful, active swimmers and do well in groups. Males are more colorful and smaller than females. A planted tank with stable water parameters enhances their health and coloration.</p>

      <h2>Neon Tetra</h2>
      <p>Neon Tetras are stunning schooling fish that glow with iridescent blue and red. They are shy and should be kept in groups of at least six. They prefer soft, slightly acidic water and appreciate heavily planted tanks with dim lighting. Tetras are sensitive to water changes, so consistency is key.</p>

      <h2>Angelfish</h2>
      <p>Angelfish are elegant cichlids that do well in tall aquariums. They can grow up to 6 inches and are semi-aggressive, so choose tankmates carefully (avoid small fish like neon tetras). They enjoy vertical plants and benefit from high-protein diets. Best kept in small groups or pairs in larger tanks.</p>

      <h2>Molly Fish</h2>
      <p>Mollies are adaptable livebearers that thrive in both freshwater and slightly brackish water. They are peaceful and do well in groups of 4 or more. Mollies need warm, alkaline water and can benefit from a bit of aquarium salt. Great for planted tanks and easy to breed.</p>

      <h2>Platy Fish</h2>
      <p>Platies are colorful, social fish that breed readily and are great for beginners. They prefer slightly alkaline water and enjoy a mix of flakes, veggies, and frozen foods. Keep them in groups of 3 or more to reduce stress. They mix well with other peaceful species.</p>

      <h2>Corydoras Catfish</h2>
      <p>Corydoras are peaceful, bottom-dwelling fish that help clean leftover food. They should be kept in groups of at least 5 and require soft substrate to protect their barbels. Corys love to scavenge and are compatible with most community tanks. Provide hiding spots and plenty of oxygen.</p>

      <h2>Zebra Danio</h2>
      <p>Zebra Danios are hardy, fast-swimming fish that do best in schools of 6 or more. They’re ideal for beginners and tolerate a range of water conditions. These fish are playful and enjoy a tank with open swimming space. Avoid slow-moving or long-finned tankmates, as Danios can be fin-nippers.</p>

      <h2>Discus Fish</h2>
      <p>Discus are stunning centerpiece fish known for their vibrant colors and calm demeanor. They require soft, warm, very clean water and are sensitive to changes. Best suited for experienced aquarists, Discus should be kept in groups of 5–6 and prefer taller tanks with vertical plants and driftwood.</p>
