  <h1>Hamster as Pets</h1>

  <div class="hamster-section">
    <div class="hamster-info">
      <h2>Syrian Hamster</h2>
      <p>Also known as Golden Hamsters, Syrian hamsters are the most popular pet hamster breed. They are solitary and must be housed alone to prevent fighting. Friendly and easy to tame, they are great for beginners and children with supervision. Syrians are relatively large and easy to handle. They need a spacious cage with tunnels, platforms, and a solid-surface running wheel. Regular handling from a young age helps build a strong bond.</p>

      <h2>Roborovski Hamster</h2>
      <p>Roborovski hamsters, or "Robo" hamsters, are the smallest and fastest of all pet hamsters. Due to their speed and tiny size, they are more suitable for observation than handling. They thrive in same-sex pairs or small groups and love burrowing and digging. Provide a tank-style enclosure with plenty of bedding for tunneling. Robos are very clean and rarely bite but can be shy around humans.</p>

      <h2>Dwarf Campbell Russian Hamster</h2>
      <p>This active and social breed can live in same-sex pairs or small groups if raised together. They are curious and fun to watch but may nip if startled or handled roughly. Campbell's hamsters enjoy exercise and benefit from wheels, tubes, and toys. Be cautious of diabetes, as they are prone to itâ€”avoid sugary treats. Handle gently and regularly to encourage trust.</p>

      <h2>Dwarf Winter White Russian Hamster</h2>
      <p>Very similar to the Campbell's, Winter White hamsters can change fur color to white in winter months. They are typically more docile and better suited for handling. These hamsters can live in same-sex pairs or small groups with minimal conflict. They enjoy digging, foraging, and sleeping together in cozy hideouts. Provide deep bedding and watch for signs of stress if housed with others.</p>

      <h2>Chinese Hamster</h2>
      <p>Chinese hamsters are slender and have longer tails than other breeds. They are gentle and can become quite tame with regular, calm handling. Best kept alone to avoid territorial issues. Their agility and calm demeanor make them a favorite among experienced hamster owners. Offer climbing toys and vertical space to keep them stimulated, as they enjoy exploring upright structures.</p>
